# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function
A parameter is identifiying values that are passed into a function.
An argument is calling the function
# 2. In your own words, describe what 
# a conditional statement (if/else) is 
If the condition is true, the statement will be executed.
If false it won't be executed
# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
a = 2
b = 200
if b > a
  print('b is greater than a')
else: 
  print('b is not greater than a')
# 3. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean. 
def foodinfridge(timetocook)
  foodinfridge = ('bacon, eggs, and  cheese')
  if foodinfridge == True
  print('time to cook')
else:
  print('Go shopping')
# 4. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should parameter should accept an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".
