# 1. Describe what a computer program is and what does it do. 

A Computer Program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute in order to perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal.

# 2. Describe what complexitity and abstraction are, then provide an example
# of complexity in the real world and how we apply abstraction to that thing (you example must be original and cannot be an example
# used in our lecture slides ie car, grocery store, etc.). 

Abstraction is the process of simplify and manage complexity.
Complexity is the measure of how resource intensive a program can be.
One example of complexity is traffic and they abstract that by making traffic lights.

# 3. What is Syntax in Python and why is it important to write proper syntax?

Syntax are the way a computer reads and understands our programs.The program won't run unless you have proper syntax.

# 4. What is a function, and why do we wrap our code inside of functions?

Functions are a type of abstraction that allows us to simplify code by being able to write code and package code up in a certain way for better modularity and reusibility.

# 5. Name and describe the three (3) naming conventions for variables in python? Then provide three (3) name rules for Python
# variables. 

Variables are containers for storing data values.
3 naming conventions are pascal case, snake case, and camel case

3 name rules are 
A variable must start with a letter or underscore
A variable can't start with a number
A variable name cannot be any of the python keywords

# 6. What will be the output of the print functons when this code is ran, explain why
name = 'Bill'
student = name
name = 'Walter'
student= 'Richard'

print(name)
print(student)
 
It will be an error because it changes

# 7. Describe the difference between each of the following assignment operators:

 = 
 ==  Equal
 !=  Not equal

 
# 8. What type of data can be stored in a python list?

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# 9. Create a function that will take in a word provided by a user and then output that word back to the user but in reverse. 

# 10. Create three (3) seperate functions that will do addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively. 
# each of these functions should take two (2) arguments. When the user passes these arguments into the function, they will be
# calculated together and return the output in your terminal. 

# 11. What is the difference between a function argument and a function parameter. 
An argument is a value passed into a function. A parameter receives the argument.
# 12. You have been hired by a software company and your first assignment is to develop a password authenticator program. 
# the goal of your program is to check a user's password and make sure it meets the company's password requirements. 
# the company has provided you with the following requirements for the passcode program:
# a. the passcode must NOT contain any numbers
# b. the passcode must NOT contain any capital letters
# c. the passcode can NOT be any longer than five (5) characters
# d. the passcode can NOT shorter the three (3) characters
# e. the user should be able to enter their password and if it meets the requirements, should print a message saying that 
# their password was created successfully, and if it was not, should send back a message with one of the following issues. 

# 13. When you run your code and see typeError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve
# the issue?

TypeError means the program couldn't be ran because the value wasn't the expected type

# 14. When you run your code and see indentError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve 
# the issue?

Occurs when you don't space or tab properly

# 15. Create a while loop that check a user's password. If they enter the password correct, they will get a message saying 
# that the password was entered successfully. If they enter the password incorrectly, it will tell the user to try again. 
# The user should only have three (3) attempts to get the password correct. If they enter the password incorrect on the fourth 
# attempt, a message should appear telling them that have been locked out and need to talk to the administrator. 

# 16. Which item is at index 5

giftShopping=['xbox','sneakers','necklace','clothing','laptop','gift card']
print(giftShopping[5])

# 17. Create a for loop that will print ONLY the even numbers within the range of the variable provided below.
# HINT: You will need to use the range() function. 
upToNumber = 30

# 18. Create a function that uses a conditional statement that checks if a person qualifies for a raise on their salary. 
# The user should be able to enter their name, their salary (how much money they make in an entire year), and how long they have
# worked at the company. If the user has been working at the company longer than four (4) years, they will get a 15% raise. 
# Your program should be able to calculate what their salary is with the 15% increase. If the user qualifies, your program
# should return the a message congratulating the user by name, and telling them what their new salary is with the 15%
# increase (this must be the actual number). If they do not qualify inform the user that unfortunately they do not qualify. 

# 19. Create a function that checks which value is greater than the other. Your function should take two (2) integer parameters. 
# and should evaluate which number is larger. Your function should then print the largest number. 

# 20. Create a while loop function that will add gift items to a list. Your function should ask the user to enter an item name. 
# The item name should then be added to a list variable called gift_bag. Your gift bag should have a limit of six (6) items. 
# Once your gift bag hits its limit of six (6) items your program should print a message saying 
# that the gift bag is full and print the list of items in the gift bag.
